# This file contains a list of pixels to be added to the bad pixel mask. This
# list can be used as a catch-all to be sure that known bad pixels which may
# not be found using the bad pixel search algorithms are still flagged.
#
# Note that entries in the x and y columns can be single numbers, or a range
# of pixels, following python's indexing notation (e.g. 10:20, which will flag
# pixels 10 - 19 as bad). Also note that coordinates are assumed to be in a
# 0-indexed coordinate system.
#
# Flag values must be strings that match those in the jwst calibration
# pipeline's list of bad pixel types. Values are not case sensitive.

# This is a list of bad pixels for the NIRCam A1 detector
